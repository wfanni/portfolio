                    <p>Hi there! I'm Fanni, a Frontend developer who's enthusiastic about taking on challenges and opportunities for learning. Since I first dabbled in coding I realized that creating user friendly interfaces is my passion.</p>

                    <p>My dream is to live and work in an environment where I can pursue both of my passions; Frontend Development and Travel. Meeting people excites me and I strongly believe that a supportive team is crucial for success.</p>
                    <p>I am eager to see what the future holds for me and ready to confront any obstacles head on! I am open to opportunities, collaborations and expanding my skill set so please don't hesitate to reach out if you found me interesting.</p>
